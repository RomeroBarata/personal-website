Hi, welcome to my personal website! My name is Romero Morais and I'm currently a PhD student at Deakin University (Australia).

Here you can find a list of my published articles, the projects I've worked on, and blog posts about various things that I'm interested about. Normally my blog posts will be related to my research, but don't be surprised if you see something about programming or math.

If you wish to contact me, please see the links at the bottom of my homepage (email, twitter, etc.).
