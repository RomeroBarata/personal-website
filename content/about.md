My name is Romero Morais and I am a Research Fellow with the [Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/) (A2I2 / Deakin University). My main area of research is in human behaviour understanding in computer vision.

I obtained my PhD from Deakin University under the supervision of Dr. [Vuong Le](https://vuongle2.github.io/) and Prof. [Truyen Tran](https://truyentran.github.io/index.html).

Born and raised in Recife (Brazil), I have always had a keen interest in Computer Science. I have a Bachelor's (2015) and a Master's (2018) Degree in Computer Science from Federal University of Pernambuco (Brazil). During my Bachelor I received a scholarship to study abroad in Melbourne (Australia) where I fell in love with the people and the culture.

In my spare time I enjoy playing with my kids, travelling, video games, [playing the guitar](http://soundcloud.com/papapenguin/choro-mazurka-villa-lobos-by-romero-barata-morais?fbclid=IwAR0abGK5kg_fcfv18TGAKQ3dUvA2HgwhP3GrNveghEXe75-BZ9I7cDsBoHc), and solving math problems (especially fun probability ones).
