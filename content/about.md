My name is Romero Morais and I am a PhD student at Deakin University (Australia). I work on understanding human behaviour in computer vision under the supervision of Prof. [Truyen Tran](https://truyentran.github.io/index.html) and Dr. Vuong Le.

Born and raised in Recife (Brazil), I have always had a keen interest in Computer Science. I have a Bachelor's (2015) and a Master's (2018) Degree in Computer Science from Federal University of Pernambuco (Brazil). During my Bachelor I received a scholarship to study abroad in Melbourne (Australia) where I fell in love with the people and the culture. 

In my spare time I enjoy travelling, video games, playing the guitar and solving math problems (especially problems related to probability).
